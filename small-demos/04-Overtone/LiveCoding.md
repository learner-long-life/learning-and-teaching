LiveCoding
==========

An important facility in livecoding is the ability to execute code on-the-fly.
This allows you to try out new sounds as you are experimenting, as well as when you're performing.

I use Emacs Live, a distribution of Emacs plugins that starts up an internal SuperCollider server and connects to it.

You can follow [this curated guide](http://overtone.github.com/emacs-live) to install and work with Emacs Live.

Now you can open up Cassiopeia from Repl-Electric and evaluate each of the expressions line-by-line to learn what's going on.
