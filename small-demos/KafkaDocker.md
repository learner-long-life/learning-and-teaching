Kafka and Docker
================

The following writeup is a WIP and does not completely work yet.
We build on the `spotify/kafka` docker image but are experiencing
problems with the `advertised.host.name` server config setting when running
the docker container on Mac.

You might say, why not just run this on Linux.
Well that's great but I already have a MacBook that I'm not paying
constant rent on.

## Kafka and Zookeeper in Docker

We use the single-container image for running Kafka and Zookeeper from Spotify

```
git clone https://github.com/spotify/docker-kafka
```

Edit the file `kafka/Dockerfile` with version numbers updated to the latest versions of Kafka and Scala at the time of this writing.

```
ENV SCALA_VERSION 2.12
ENV KAFKA_VERSION 0.11.0.0
```

Then build the image:

```
docker build . -t kafka/spotify:latest
```

When it's done, start up the image in a `tmux` pane and voila:
```
â‡’  docker run -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 spotify/kafka
